                <p>“I’ve had the absolute pleasure of working with Ottawa Photography on 2 of our most recent campaigns; ‘Marmalade’ and ‘Je T’aime’. I couldn’t have asked for a better Photographer and person if I tried. It’s not just you incredible eye for creating the perfect image, it’s her down to earth personality that I love too. There was no over choreographed looks, it was just easy and fluent. Because of this, the result was natural, soft and captured so much mood. The best part about working with Cass is that I know I’m in good hands. I can simply hand over the task and I know that I will love the result. I can’t wait to work with Cassandra again, hopefully on some deserted island in the middle of nowhere.”<br>

             <p>“I saw a photo from a wedding Cass shot in Santorini, back in 2013 and I knew straight away there was no other photographer that could capture our special day as candidly and beautifully as Cass. Since then she has been a part of all the special moments in our life, including family sessions at home when our kids were born. Cass is a pleasure to work with and has become a true friend in the years we have known her. I treasure every moment she has captured for us and can’t wait to work with her again.”
