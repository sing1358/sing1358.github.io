                <p>
                    We are excited to welcome everyone back to the Gurdwara Sahib on Sunday June 14th, as we begin the process of re-opening the Gurdwara Sahib. At this time, we will only be open for Matha-Tek, from 9:00 am to 5:00 pm every day. We will not be serving Langar or tea. Furthermore, washrooms and other parts of the building will not be accessible. We also ask for your patience as there could be a line up for Matha-Tek and you might have to wait longer than usual.<br>

As we are still under a Public Health Emergency from the Government of Ontario, we will be following all directives from all levels of government, including limiting the number of people inside at any one time. We have put certain protocols in place to ensure everyone’s health and well-being in order to reduce and eliminate the possible spread of COVID-19. We respectfully request your cooperation and patience as we gradually bring the Gurdwara Sahib back to full operations over the coming months.<br>

As we work with the different levels of government, we are required to collect some data, which may help health officials with contact tracing in case of any possible COVID-19 cases. Therefore, everyone who visits the Gurdwara premises will be asked to fill out a contact tracing form on arrival. These forms and any online data are deleted after 30 days and are not used for any other purposes. The data is only shared with public health officials in the instance of a COVID-19 case being linked to the Gurdwara Sahib.<br>

Each person will be asked the following questions prior to entering the Gurdwara Sahib:<br>
1. Are you or anyone in your household experiencing any of the following: fever, coughing, difficulty breathing, sore throat, runny nose, and/or shortness of breath?
2. Have you or anyone in your household traveled outside of Ontario in the past 14 days?<br>
3. Have you or anyone in your household been investigated, tested positive, or been in contact with anyone who has tested positive for COVID-19 in the past 14 days?<br>

Your temperature will be checked with a no-touch thermal scan thermometer.<br>

Apart from that, you must:<br>
• Maintain a physical distance of 2 metres or 6′ from other members of Sangat who are not part of your household.<br>
• Wear a mask or other face covering (fully covering your mouth, nose, and chin) at all times while on the premises.<br>
• Bring your own head covering (rumaal/chunni) from home.<br>
• Wash or sanitize your hands upon entry and exit from the Gurdwara Sahib.<br>
• Avoid touching any surface unnecessarily.<br>
• Follow any instructions given by OSS committee members, Sevadars, or Giani jis.<br>
• Always act in a manner to ensure the safety of yourself and of others.<br>
• Stay home if you are experiencing any symptoms of any illness.<br>
• Stay home if you have pre-existing health conditions that render you more vulnerable for COVID-19.<br>
• Stay home if you are designated as a vulnerable person with respect to COVID-19.<br>
• Leave at the conclusion of your Matha-Tek without socializing or hanging out on the Gurdwara Sahib’s premises, including in the parking lot.<br>

Lastly, please note that by attending the Gurdwara Sahib, you voluntarily assume all risks related to exposure to COVID-19 and agree not to hold the Gurdwara Sahib, directors, sevadars or giani jis liable for any illness.<br>

Thank you in advance for your cooperation.
OSS Sevadar<br>

Email is the best way to contact Gurdwara Sahib, but if you are unable to do that, then you can also phone OSS at 613-225- 8280. This number will be answered by the Gianijis.<br>
