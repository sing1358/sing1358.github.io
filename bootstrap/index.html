                    The Ottawa Sikh Society (OSS) was formed as a charitable organization in March 1968. The constitution of the Society was drafted in the same year and has been amended from time to time to improve the efficiency of the OSS and to address the growing needs of Ottawa’s Sikh Community. In August 1974, it was incorporated as a legal entity with Ministry of Consumer and Commercial Relations, Province of Ontario.
